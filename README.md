### :handbag: A simple RESTful API for KEYBOARD AND KEYCAP Purchases .

## Introduction:

"KIBI" e-commerce store is a webapplication that features the 7 RESTful routes
The idea to build an e-cmoorece store to offer verioute selection of an amazing keyborads was born based on hobbiest among team members.  

## Features: 
View products.
Edit a product listing.
Create a product listing
Delete a product listing
MAYBE: Ability to filter items

## Development Tools:

The application was built with Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS. The file structure is compliant with the MVC format. There are two different models, each with corresponding seed files. Some of the HTML is set up using EJS Partials. The repository is maintained on Github. The application is deployed on Heroku.


## Future Improvements:
 This application could be developed further with additions such as a shopping cart or functionality to accept payments securely. Another improvement would be to create a community of frequent customers who would log into the app. They could have increased functionality over non-logged in users. (For example, making listing an item a function that only logged-in users can do.) Users could then benefit from coupons, or other such perks.
